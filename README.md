## What is Rectangle?

Rectangle is a highly versatile and feature-rich application designed to completely transform how you handle your workspace. It empowers users to efficiently manage multiple windows, enabling them to snap, align, and arrange apps with a few keystrokes or mouse actions. This is particularly useful for people juggling complex workflows involving coding, design, content creation, or financial analysis, where managing multiple applications simultaneously is crucial.

Unlike other window management solutions, Rectangle combines simplicity with immense power. Users can create highly personalized layouts, assign custom shortcuts, and manage windows across multiple displays. Its intuitive visual guides make arranging windows not only easy but also precise, ensuring that every application is perfectly positioned. Rectangle also supports restoring window arrangements, which is essential for users who rely on consistent layouts for repetitive workflows. This feature alone can save hours of time and mental effort each week.

Rectangle is lightweight and optimized to run efficiently on both Intel and Apple Silicon systems. It is highly responsive, even when handling dozens of windows simultaneously, making it ideal for developers, designers, project managers, or anyone who needs to maintain an organized workspace. The appâ€™s integration with advanced system features ensures minimal interference with other processes, allowing you to focus entirely on your work without distraction.

### Key Features of Rectangle:

* Effortless snapping and alignment of application windows.  
* Fully customizable keyboard shortcuts for precise window control.  
* Drag-and-drop snapping with clear visual guides.  
* Multi-monitor support for expansive workspace setups.  
* Lightweight, efficient, and optimized for Intel and Apple Silicon.  
* Minimal interface, instant usability, and fast learning curve.  
* Layout restoration for repetitive workflows.  
* Advanced customization to fit personal productivity styles.

Rectangle isnâ€™t just about managing windows; itâ€™s about redefining productivity. By automating the process of organizing applications, it eliminates wasted time and mental clutter. Users can focus on what truly matters, whether thatâ€™s coding large projects, designing complex visuals, or tracking multiple documents and datasets simultaneously. Its powerful set of tools and intuitive interface ensures that users can work faster, smarter, and with more control over their environment.

Rectangle helps create a workflow where every window is exactly where itâ€™s needed, in the exact size required. This attention to detail transforms chaotic desktops into highly efficient workspaces, supporting peak productivity. It also encourages good habits in workspace organization, which can reduce stress and improve focus over long working sessions. The app is an essential companion for anyone looking to take full control of their digital workspace, ensuring that time is spent on meaningful work rather than constantly rearranging applications.
